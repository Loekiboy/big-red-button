🔴 The Big Red Button
Whatever you do, do NOT press the button ;)

big-red-button is an interactive "troll" website. It starts simple, but the more you click, the more the button begins to fight back. It has a mind of its own, and it's not happy about your persistence.

Features
This isn't just a button, experience several phases of button-anger, including:

- Dialogue: The button will talk (and yell) at you.
- Evasion: It starts moving away when you try to hover over it.
- The Vanishing Act: It might just leave the site entirely... unless you make a promise.
- The Pixel Hunt: Think you're fast? Try clicking a 1x1 pixel moving target.
- The Grand Finale: Contains a jumpscare and a literal "Nuclear Option" that might overload your browser tabs.
